### Working Agreements
* Our usual workday is from 9am to 7pm. We will take a lunch break, but not a dinner break. Individuals may choose to do additional work outside these hours if we wish.
* We will all work in the same space in person at DBC, under ordinary circumstances.
* On Sunday, Harry will take off the morning for church responsibilities and contribute remotely in the afternoon, working on
something with few dependencies, while Lucian and Debbie work together in person, possibly not at DBC.
* We will build the core application and complete the minimum viable product before beginning to work on additional features or enhancements.
* We will maintain kindness, sanity, and a healthy schedule of eating and sleeping.
* We will use git rebase, not git merge.
